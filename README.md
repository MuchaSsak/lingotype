# LingoType

A foreign language learning app for vocabulary reinforcement by typing ‚å®Ô∏èüåê 

This project was made in collaboration with [Fabian Dr√≥≈ºkowski](https://github.com/RocketPLN). It's worth to mention that we had only a short time to work on it, so the code can be messy at times. We also did not finish a lot of features we had in mind. The thing that matters though, is that we built something cool ‚≠ê
